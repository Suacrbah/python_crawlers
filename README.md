# Python Crawlers

Some Python crawlers I wrote for practice

## Douyin comments Crawler

this simple crawler collects the comments below a specific video on Douyin andanalyse whether they contain the desired words, the words are entered in the terminal by the user.

### Demonstration on how to use.

First, if you don't have `json` and `urllib` module, open the command prompt and type in the following commands:
```
pip install urllib
pip install json
```

Once you finished installing, direct cmd to the crawler files to execute the crawler:
`python douyin.py [words] [words] ... `
