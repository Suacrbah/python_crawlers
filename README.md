# Python Crawlers

Some Python crawlers I wrote for practice

## Douyin comments Crawler

this simple crawler collects the comments below a specific video on Douyin and
analyse whether they contain the desired words, the words are entered in the terminal
by the user.

### Demonstration on how to use.

First, if you don't have `json` and `urllib` module, open the command prompt and
type in the following commands:
```
> pip install urllib
> pip install json
```
